# RevitFileOpener

Working example of aamahmoud's code from:
https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/open-document-and-ignore-errors/m-p/6726436#M19768

The Revit Addin will open all files in a folder one by one bypassing open warnings.
It will then delete all views that begin with a given prefix.
